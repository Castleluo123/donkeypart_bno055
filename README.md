# Donkey Car Part Bosch BNO055 IMU
The BNO055 is the first in a new family of Application Specific Sensor Nodes (ASSN) implementing an intelligent 9-axis Absolute Orientation Sensor, which includes sensors and sensor fusion in a single package.
## Custom Donkey Car part BNO055 IMU
I developed this part to support the BNO055 sensor I used on my Donkey Car.
I tested this part with the Dexter Industrial IMU Board.

This part should also work with the Adafruit BNO055 sensor board as well and with cheap clones from China.
